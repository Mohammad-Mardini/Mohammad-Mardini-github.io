I'm a post-doc in the University of Tokyo, the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe ([IPMU](https://www.ipmu.jp)). 

My research focuses on identifying, spectroscopic follow-up, detailed chemical abundance, and kinematics study of the oldest stars in our Galaxy. In principle, I use these stars to extract information about the properties of the first stars (e.g., initial mass function, chemical yields) to ultimately place constraint on the chemical enrichment of the early Galaxy.

Also, I use the positions, motions, and chemistry of ancient stars to detect chemodynamical fossil signatures, which are crucial to completely reconstruct the formation history of the Milky Way.
