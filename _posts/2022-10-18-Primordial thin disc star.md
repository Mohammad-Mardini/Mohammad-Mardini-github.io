2MASS J18082002−5104378 (shortened as J1808−5104) is the most primitive thin disk star ever discovered. Its estimated age ([13.5 Gyr](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aadd97)) suggest that J1808−5104 was born in the early Milky Way. Recently, I wrote a [paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stac2783/6731788) discussing the origin of J1808−5104 and its orbital history. In this study, I used my novel time-dependent gravitational potential to confirm that J1808−5104 was born in the Galactic thin disk and sustained its thin disk-like kinematics through the violent evolution of the Milky Way.
