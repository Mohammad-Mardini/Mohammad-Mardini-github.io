My PhD thesis at the National Astronomical Observatories of China was recognized with the 2019 Excellent PhD student award. My thesis centered around searches for the chemical fingerprints of the first stars using high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with the Automated Planet Finder Telescope of metal-poor candidates identified from the third data release of LAMOST. ðŸš€ ðŸŒŸ ðŸš€
