The ORIENT (cOsmologically deRIved timE-varyiNg Galactic poTential) is a library for integrating trajectories in time-varying gravitational potentials, derived from Milky Way analogues selected from the [Illustris-TNG simulation](https://www.tng-project.org). The ORIENT is now publicly available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Mohammad-Mardini/The-ORIENT).

The use of this library provides a unique opportunity for the astronomical society to mimic the realistic formation and evolution history of the Milky Way, better than other time-fixed Galactic potential available. Therefore, we can use the ORIENT to ultimately provide clues on the origin of the most metal-poor stars, and place constraints on the formation and evolution of the Galaxy.
