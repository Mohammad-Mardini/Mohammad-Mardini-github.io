During my co-teaching of the 8.S30 (Observational Stellar Archaeology) course at MIT Physics department. It was a wonderful experience to teach such brilliant students and being in the most educated piece on land on Earth. During the summer, students got the chance to discover and study their own ancient metal-poor star. In this course, we used [The-ORIENT](https://github.com/Mohammad-Mardini/The-ORIENT)to perform a full chemodynamical analysis.
