Co-teaching 8.S30 (class on Observational Stellar Archaeology) at MIT Physics department. It was wonderful experience during the summer, 
where students got the chance to discover their own ancient metal-poor star. In this course, we used [The-ORIENT](https://github.com/Mohammad-Mardini/The-ORIENT)
to perform a full chemodynamical analysis.
